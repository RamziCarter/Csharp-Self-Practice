# Csharp-Self-Practice
This repository is to show my interest in the C# programming language and my efforts to learn more as a devloper in an effort to expand my skills. I have a computer science degree and I decided I wanted to start developing some personal projects for the public eye.

Have a look! 
I started this repository from a online coding source on Youtube: BroCode. 

I progressed through the C# tutorials and created my own programs which really helped me learn C# basics.
